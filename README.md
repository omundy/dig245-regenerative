## Introduction

This assignment asks you to create a web page that can generate new iterations of itself based on some changeable data source. This could be input from the user, other available data (e.g. time, location, etc.), or pure randomness.

Nearly every software or dynamic website generates their interfaces using data. Even a boring shopping website uses cookies to identify and customize pages for users ([regardless who stands to benefit](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/amazon-marketplace-seller-pleads-guilty-price-fixing-dvds-and-blu-ray-discs)).

This process is evident in many other "design" contexts. For example, [Generative Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_design) is a related cultural trend that, similar to data-driven websites, uses coded rules and algorithms to create (and recreate) concepts and forms for architecture, objects, behaviors, animations, games, and much more. This diagram from, [Generative Design: Visualize, Program, and Create with JavaScript in p5.js](http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/) by Groß, Bohnacker, and Laub, shows how these processes can create new iterations, using varying degrees of input from the creator, to ideate or solve specific design or aesthetic problems. 

In addition to problem solving for humans, you could also imagine a different audience. For example, consider making this proejct for your computer or your dog or a cup of coffee. Regardless of your approach, your project should mimic or somehow find inspiration in these processes, to reflect your own thinking on the subject.

### Learning Objectives

Students who complete this assignment will be able to:

- Describe how to use data to create generative processes in software, design, architecture, etc.
- Compare outcomes of generative processes across disciplines.
- Write pseudo code and build a prototype to plan and develop a web application.
- Use HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JS build  final application.
- Design an identity for the project that communicates a theme or concept

## Design

Follow the prompt in Chapter 8 of *Critical Web Design* ... 

1. Find [inspiration](#inspiration) in other works.
1. Develop a concept for your project. Consider the above prompt and inspiration.
1. Use [Figma](https://figma.com) to create a wireframe and design iterations for your project. Start with desktop design, then create the mobile layout once you have made a few iterations. 
1. Use Figma to diagram any data transformations or flowcharts as needed. Show the different stages of the user experience or how your app changes depending on the content.


## Code

1. Fork this repository and clone it to your machine.
1. Begin the code portion by writing out the pseudocode for your project. [See this activity for practice](https://github.com/omundy/learn-computing/blob/main/topics/computational-thinking.md#pseudocode). Save the pseudocode in a comment in your Javascript.
1. Use HTML, CSS, and JS to code your design inside `index.html`
1. Use Javascript variables, conditional logic, loops, etc. to somehow change the page every time it loads.
1. Use images, other media, or code libraries as needed.


## Publish

1. [Save and refresh](https://github.com/omundy/learn-computing/blob/main/topics/keyboard-shortcuts.md#web-development-edit-save-refresh-loop) your work in the browser often to see your changes.
1. Commit changes regularly.
1. Confirm valid [HTML](https://validator.w3.org/) and [CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) <sup>([?](https://github.com/omundy/dig245-critical-web-design/blob/main/topics/html-css/css.md#css-validation))</sup>
1. When finished, push, publish, and post all deliverables to Moodle per documentation in the Assignments.
